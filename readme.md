# Cinema E-Booking System

## Problem Statement

The online booking system manages one theatre with a few employees and halls. It stores information about thousands of movies, showtimes, and registered customers.

The system is a web-based application that allows internet users to:

- View information about movies.
- Book tickets and seats online.
- Pay for tickets online and save or print them.

The system also stores registered user data and provides registration functionality. Administrators can add and update movies, ticket prices, and user information, as well as view real-time statistics about bookings, sales, running movies, and registered users.

Ticket prices vary by age category: **Child**, **Adult**, and **Senior**.

## Development Process

The software will be developed following a hybrid model that combines **Waterfall** and **Agile**:

- **Waterfall**: Used for overall project planning, phases, and deliverables.
- **Agile**: Injected within planned phases to refine requirements before each sprint, produce early working versions, and incorporate continuous testing.

**Highlights:**
- Coding is scheduled in sprints.
- Teams can work concurrently (e.g., UI design while building database tables).
- Prototypes will be used for UI feedback to reduce risk of failure.
- Final testing will include subsystem, integration, and acceptance testing.

ðŸ“… Final project demonstration: **Tuesday, 11/30/2022**.
